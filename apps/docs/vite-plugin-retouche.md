# `vite-plugin-retouche`

## `root`

The `root` option will default to the current working directory. At times, this behaviour is inconvenient. Therefore, it can be changed manually.

## `plugins`

To further modify the output of `vite-plugin-retouche`, you can provide plugins. If these plugins support additional attributes, you will have to provide custom [interaction](/interactions) hooks.
